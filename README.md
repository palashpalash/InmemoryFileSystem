For Creation :

Suppose We want to create a folder . for that We need to specify folder name and space and location of the folder with its name and extension.
ex : s {drivename}\p\s (where drivename is name of the drive,  then p is another folder lies within drive then the folder name that is 's' which we are tryinmg to create )
